# underwater-gesture-recognition

This repository contains the codes used in the paper "Underwater Gesture Recognition Using Classical Computer Vision and Deep Learning Techniques". The codes are divided into three groups: one for each model used in the paper.

### 1. Bag of Visual Words (BOVW):
- Scripts (adopted from Kushal Vyasâ€™ implementation of Bag of Visual Words: https://github.com/kushalvyas/Bag-of-Visual-Words-Python)   
- To test:  
	1. Put train images in ```./images/train folder```; this is needed to get the classes to be used in testing
	2. Put test images in ```./images/test folder```
	3. Put ```kmeans_cluster_3.sav```, ```mega_histogram_3.pkl```, ```svm_train_3.pkl```, ```and vstack_3.pkl``` in the same directory as Bag.py and helpers.py (Link to pretrained weights: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hSaZwRpbtOqFYep7Z4jW2kkKizEHoVqO)
    	4. Run ```python Bag.py```  

- Dependencies:  
	-OpenCV 3.4.2.17 (OpenCV-contrib-python==3.4.2.17), scikit-learn 0.20.3  

### 2. Histogram of Gradients (HOG):  
- To test:  
	1. Put test images in ```./images/test``` folder
    	2. Put ```hog_svm.joblib``` pre-trained model in ```./models``` folder (Link to pretrained weights: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pirGWIkZqWXBNSwQKuTdLpmMKowYrOUK)
	3. Create ```./results/``` folder, where the csv containing the target classes and predictions will be saved  
	4. Run testing.py  
- To visualize sample correct and incorrect predictions per class:  
    	1. Create ```./visualization/``` folder, which will contain the sample images with predictions  
    	2. Run ```visualize_predictions.py```  
- Dependencies:  
	-OpenCV 4.1.0.25 (opencv-contrib-python==4.1.0.25), scikit-learn 0.21.0  

### 3. ResNet50-CNN  
- To test:  
	1. Place the test in ```./images/test``` folder  
	2. Put the pre-trained model ```resnet50_CNN_caddy.pickle``` in the same directory as classifier_withtest.py (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EQxRwaFTZVlmVlTZDVx5Y1fcLAxjL6Qj/view?usp=sharing)  
	3. Run ```classifier_withtest.py``` 
- Dependencies:  
    - pytorch 0.4.0  
    - cuda 9.0
