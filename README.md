# underwater-gesture-recognition

This repository contains the codes used in the paper "Underwater Gesture Recognition Using Classical Computer Vision and Deep Learning Techniques". The codes are divided into three groups: one for each model used in the paper.

1. Bag of Visual Words (BOVW):
  •	Scripts (adopted from Kushal Vyas’ implementation of Bag of Visual Words: https://github.com/kushalvyas/Bag-of-Visual-Words-Python)  
    o	Bag.py – main script for training and testing  
    o	helper.py – contains helper scripts for training and testing  
  •	To test:  
    o	Put train images in ./images/train folder; this is needed to get the classes to be used in  testing   
    > Link to train images: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JCXaT9PSnyJ4KgTzlumMrmwALVt-2V_t  
    o	Put test images in ./images/test folder   
    > Link to test images: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ducpYZnC9dQznG90HbiyZSX3CYCR8UbR  
    Put kmeans_cluster_3.sav, mega_histogram_3.pkl, svm_train_3.pkl, and vstack_3.pkl in the same directory as Bag.py and helpers.py   
    > Link to pretrained weights: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hSaZwRpbtOqFYep7Z4jW2kkKizEHoVqO  
    o	run python Bag.py  
  •	Dependencies:  
    o	OpenCV 3.4.2.17 (OpenCV-contrib-python==3.4.2.17), scikit-learn 0.20.3  
2. Histogram of Gradients (HOG):  
  •	Scripts:  
    o	train.py  
    o	trim_hnm.py   
    o	testing.py  
    o	visualize_predictions.py  
  •	To test:  
    o	Put test images in ./images/test folder   
    > Link to test images: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ducpYZnC9dQznG90HbiyZSX3CYCR8UbR  
    o	Put hog_svm.joblib pre-trained model in ./models folder   
    > Link to pretrained weights: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pirGWIkZqWXBNSwQKuTdLpmMKowYrOUK  
    o	Create ./results/ folder, where the csv containing the target classes and predictions will be saved  
    o	Run testing.py  
  •	To visualize sample correct and incorrect predictions per class:  
    o	Create ./visualization/ folder, which will contain the sample images with predictions  
    o	Run visualize_predictions.py  
  •	Dependencies:  
    o	OpenCV 4.1.0.25 (opencv-contrib-python==4.1.0.25), scikit-learn 0.21.0  
3. ResNet50-CNN  
  •	Scripts:  
    o	data_augmentation.py  
    o	classifier_withtest.py  
  •	To test:  
    •Place the test in ./images/test folder  
    o Put the pre-trained model resnet50_CNN_caddy.pickle in the same directory as classifier_withtest.py  
    > Link to pretrained weights: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EQxRwaFTZVlmVlTZDVx5Y1fcLAxjL6Qj/view?usp=sharing  
    o Run classifier_withtest.py  
   •	Dependencies:  
    o pytorch 0.4.0  
    o Cuda 9.0
